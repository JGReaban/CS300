Projects Related to my CS300 Class

Project One was an overview and analysis of different data structures and how they compare to each other
when performing various functions, like searching, adding or removing elements, etc.

Project Two involved reading data on university courses from a CSV file and doing some very basic operations 
on them.

The general gist of the course was to see which data structure is best suited for the problem. In most cases,
a vectorseems sufficient, so I used it Project Two. However, it informed me that there are other options, tha
might work better in different situations and problems and so in future probjects I might make different choices.

Most of the difficulty was adapting the sample code from Zbybooks (for a complex structure like a hash map or
linked list) into actual C++ code for my program. Trial and errr and watching sample videos helped this.
